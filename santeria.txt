Santeria
Sublime

I don't practice Santeria, I ain't got no crystal ball
I had a million dollars but I'd, I'd spend it all
If I could find that Heina and that Sancho that she's found
I'd pop a cap in Sancho and I'd slap her down

All I really want to know
I already know
All I really want to say
I can't define
It's love that I need
My soul will have to wait 'til I get back and find
Heina of my own
Daddy's gonna love one and all
I feel the break, feel the break, feel the break and I got to live it out, oh yeah

Well I swear that I, I really want to know,
I really, what I really want to stay, I cant define
That love make it go, my soul will have to

What I really want to say, ah baby
What I really want to say, is I've got mine
And I'll make it, yes I'm going up
Tell Sanchito that if he knows what is good for him
He best go run and hide
Daddy's got a new .45
And I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down Sancho's throat
Believe me when I say that I got somethin' for his punk ass

What I really want know, ah baby
What I really want to say is there's just one way back
And I'll make it, yeah, my soul will have to wait
