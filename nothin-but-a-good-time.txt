Nothin' But a Good Time
Teddy Geiger

Not a dime
I can’t pay my rent
I can barely make it through the week
Saturday night, I’d like to make my girl
But right now, I can’t make ends meet

I’m always working, slaving every day
Gotta get away from the same old, same old
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think
This is what I’d say

Don’t need nothin’ but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain’t lookin’ for nothin’ but a good time
And it don’t get better than this

They say I spend my money
On women and wine
But I couldn’t tell you what I spend last night
I’m really sorry about the shape I’m in
I just like my fun every now and then

I’m always working, slaving every day
Gotta get away from the same old, same old
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think
This is what I’d say

Don’t need nothin’ but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain’t lookin’ for nothin’ but a good time
And it don’t get better than this

You see, I raise a toast to all of us
Who are breakin’ our backs every day
If wantin’ the good life is such a crime
Then Lord, then put me away
Here’s to ya

Don’t need nothin’ but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain’t lookin’ for nothin’ but a good time
And it don’t, don’t get better than this

Don’t need nothin’ but a good time
And how can I resist?
Ain’t lookin’ for nothin’ but a good time
And it don’t get better than this

Don’t need nothin’ but a good time
And how can I resist?
Ain’t lookin’ for nothin’ but a good time
And it don’t get better than this
Don’t get better than this
Don’t get better than this
No, it don’t get better than this
It don’t get better
Don’t get better
Don’t get better
Don’t get better than this
