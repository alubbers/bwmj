Eclipse
Pink Floyd

All that you touch
And all that you see
All that you taste
All that you feel
All that you love
All that you hate
All you distrust
All that you save
And all that you give
And all that you deal
And all that you buy, beg, borrow, or steal
And all you create
And all you destroy
And all that you do
And all that you say
And all that you eat
And everyone you meet
All that you slight
And everyone you fight
And all that is now
And all that is gone
And all that's to come
And everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon

[Outro]
(There is no dark side of the moon really
Matter of fact it's all dark)
