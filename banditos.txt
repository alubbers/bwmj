Banditos
The Refreshments

So, just how far down do you want to go?
Or we could talk it out over a cup of joe
And you could look deep into my eyes
Like I was a super-model
Uh-huh

Well, it's you and me baby, no one else we can trust
We'll say nothin' to no one, no how or we bust
And never crack a smile
Or flinch or cry for nobody
Uh-uh

Well, give your ID card to the border guard
Yeah, your alias says you're Captain Jean-Luc Picard
Of the United Federation Of Planets
'Cause he won't speak English anyway

And everybody knows
That the world is full of stupid people
So meet me at the mission at midnight
We'll divvy up there

And everybody knows
That the world is full of stupid people
Well, I got the pistols, so I'll keep the Pesos
Yeah, and that seems fair

So, put the sugar in the tank of the sheriff's car
And slash the deputy's tires and they won't get very far
When they finally get the word
That there's been a hold-up
Uh-huh

Well, give your ID card to the border guard
Now your alias says you're Captain Jean-Luc Picard
Of the United Federation Of Planets
'Cause he won't speak English anyway

And everybody knows
That the world is full of stupid people
So meet me at the mission at midnight
We'll divvy up there

And everybody knows
That the world is full of stupid people
Well, I got the pistols, so I'll keep the Pesos
Yeah, and that seems fair
Well, that seems fair
And that seems fair
Well, that seems fair

Well, give your ID card to the border guard
Now your alias says you're Captain Jean-Luc Picard
Of the United Federation Of Planets
'Cause he won't speak English anyway

And everybody knows
That the world is full of stupid people
So meet me at the mission at midnight
We'll divvy up there

Well, everybody knows
That the world is full of stupid people
Well, I got the pistols, so I'll keep the Pesos
Yeah, and that seems fair
And that seems fair
And that seems fair
Well, that seems fair
